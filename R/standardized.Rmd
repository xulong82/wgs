```{r}

c = rnorm(20, 20, 2)
t = rnorm(20, 20, 2)

lm(c(c, t) ~ c(rep("c", 20), rep("t", 20))) %>% summary

sd(c)
sd(t)

mean(c)
mean(t)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
